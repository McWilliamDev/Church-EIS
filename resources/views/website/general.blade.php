               <p class="general_text">New Ground is a God-given statement to Ps. Bhamby Belardo, during her visit to Jabez Prayer Mountain last March 21, 2024. She was praying hard about having an exit to her previous church. While praying, she was listening to a song, “NEW WINE” by Brooke Fraser and at the intensity of her prayer, the Lord just kept her silent then while listening, the lyrics of the song: … you are breaking a NEW GROUND hit her differently. It broke her into tears and after that, the Lord said, “STAY PUT”. 
                  So, she wrote on the floor what she heard from the Lord: <br><br>
                  <b>NEW GROUND</b> means something NEW and FRESH from the previous. <br><br>
                  <b>STAY PUT</b> means not to resign ASAP, but wait for His timing.
